a famous problem which no one has able to find yet.
known as simple 3n+1 
simple rule
guess any number
if it's odd multiply by 3 and add 1
if even divide by 2
and it goes on
and at the end it will end up in 4 2 1 loop
here is the problem
can anyone prove this will happen for all numbers? 
that is the problem
you can let the program run and it will do it for you or you can check after every 99 number manually
